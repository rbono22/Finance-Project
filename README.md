# Finance-Project

In this data project I focused on exploratory data analysis stock prices, and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016. Keep in mind, this project was meant to practice visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice. I used pandas datareader to get stock information for the following banks from January 1, 2006 to January 1, 2016:
* Bank of America
* CitiGroup
* Goldman Sachs
* JPMorgan Chase
* Morgan Stanley
* Wells Fargo
